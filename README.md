Online_Examination_System

An online examination system is an e-learning platform allowing any organization or educational institution to conduct assessments over the internet. It supports safe and efficient processes related to the creation, administration, and grading of exams. These typically include features like the following:
Access: Students can participate from anywhere provided there is connectivity.
Automation: The system automatically marks multiple-choice and true/false questions, freeing up educator time.
It ensures security with proctoring, random question selection, as well as time limits.
Flexibility: The tests can be taken at any time, hence making the assessment process more flexible.
The system can provide wide-ranging performance reports and analytics of students as well as teachers.
Online examination systems encourage convenience and also enable effective assessment processes, and they are accessible.
